# Algorithm Efficiency Analysis Tool

Welcome to our repository :smile:

This Tool is designed to perform analysis and comparison of different sorting algorithms. The tool takes an input of integers, performs sorting on it and displays the performance of each of the Algorithm over graphs.


<ins>The algorithms used are:</ins>
1. Bubble Sort
2. Bucket Sort
3. Counting Sort
4. Heap Sort
5. Insertion Sort
6. Merge Sort
7. Quicksort
8. Radix Sort
9. Selection Sort

<ins>The tool plots the following graphs:</ins>
1. Bar graph
2. Joint plot
3. LM plot

## Installation Procedure

**Application Requirements:**
* Python 3 (3.9 & above)

Refer to the requirements.txt file for other depedencies.

To install all the required depedencies:
1. Open Command Prompt (Windows), Terminal (Linux or Mac).
2. Navigate to the directory where this file is downloaded.
3. Install the requirements using the command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure that you have execute permissions (or access as sudo user).

## Running the Application

All the executables are located in the _src_ directory. Head to this directory. You will see the following files:
1. analysis.py
2. main.py
3. test.py
4. ui.py

Double click on the main.py file to launch the application.

**Important:**
* The application is only designed for integers. It does not work for decimal Values and Strings.
* Be aware of entering large values as this may slow down the performance of your computer. This may potentially give rise erroneous data.
* The range of values entered must be the larger than the number of elements.


We hope you find it useful :smiley:
